# SudokuSolver
This small "game" allows you to enter a 9Ã—9 Sudoku Puzzle. The game will then find a solution to the input puzzle.

You can navigate in the sudoku map using either the arrows or an wasd system.
While you are over a tile, you can input a number by digiting it.
You can also delete an inserted number by pressing backspace, canc or 0.
As soon as you press Enter the program will solve the input puzzle.
You can close the "game" by pressing the esc button (however, this will not work while the program is computing the solution to a puzzle).
